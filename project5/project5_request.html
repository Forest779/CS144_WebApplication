<h3>Change History</h3>

<h2>Enabling Secure Transaction</h2>

<p>In Project 4, you developed search and browse interfaces to help users
access items on eBay. In this project, you extend your Project 4 to
allow users to pay for an item by inputting their credit card number. Before
you move on, read the following two tutorials to learn how to enable SSL on
tomcat and how to keep information through a sequence of pages using http
session: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../tomcat/ssl_tomcat_tutorial.html">Enabling SSL on Tomcat</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../java/session/index.html">Creating a sesson-enabled servlet</a>
  </li>
</ul>
Your task for this part of the project is to enable the following sequence of
steps on your tomcat server to obtain the user's credit card number:

<p><b>Transaction workflow</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>On an item page (i.e., a page that is returned from the
    <code>ItemServlet</code> class in Project 4) if the item has "Buy_Price",
    you should display a "Pay Now" link. </li>
  <li>When the user clicks on the "Pay Now" link, your server should lead the
    user to the "credit-card-input page" that shows the ItemID, Item Name and
    Buy_Price (and optionally other information) of the item that the user is
    paying for. In addition, the page should contain one input box to let the
    user type a credit card number. For simplicity, we assume that a credit
    card number is enough for authorizing a transaction (i.e., card holder
    name, expiration date, etc. are not needed). </li>
  <li>Once the user presses the "Submit" button on the credit-card-input page,
    your server should show the final "confirmation page", where the user can
    see the ItemID, Item Name, Buy_Price, credit card number, and transaction
    time (and optionally other information that you think is relevant). </li>
</ol>
The image below illustrates the sequence of the pages that the user will see
through these steps:

<p><img style="width: 50%;" alt="fig_schema_1" title="fig_schema_1"
src="fig_schema_1.png"></p>
Your task for this project is to implement the relevant Java servlet classes
and JSP pages to support the above transaction workflow. Of course, you are
taking a serious security risk when you enable online transaction by the users,
so you have to be extra careful. In particular, you are working with the
following important requirements for this project:

<p></p>

<p><b>Basic requirements</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Protecting the credit card number from a malicious third party is
    essential. No one should be able to eavesdrop on your communication and
    obtain your customer's credit card number while it is in transit over the
    Internet. </li>
  <li>There should be no possibility for a malicious (and technically savvy)
    user to purchase an item for a price other than its Buy_Price. </li>
</ol>
For simplicity, other requirements that may be important for a real-world Web
site are not enforced in this project. For instance, we do not worry about
whether the user-provided credit card number is fraudulent or not, and we do
not check whether the user who pays for an item is the same user who won the
auction or not. Only the above two requirements need to be guaranteed for this
project.

<p>You may think that you can meet the above requirements simply by (a)
encrypting every communication between the tomcat server and the user's browser
with HTTPS and (b) obtaining Buy_Price directly from oak whenever it is
displayed to the user. Unforutnately things are a bit more comlicated due to a
few additional preformance-related constraints. We refer to the following
figure to illustrate these constraints and data flow among the machines. </p>

<p><img style="width: 50%;" alt="fig_schema_2" title="fig_schema_2"
src="fig_schema_2.png"> </p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Important constraints</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>SSL communication is computationally very expensive, so you need to
    protect your commuication through HTTPS <em>only when the credit card
    number is in transit</em>. All other communication between your server and
    the browser should be done through plain HTTP, not HTTPS.
    <p>Note that if you want to encrypt a communication from the browser to the
    server through SSL, you simply need to make the beginning of the request
    URL "<tt>https://...</tt>" (as long as the URL has the correct port number
    for the SSL connection). Then both the request to and the response from
    the server will be encrypted. If you want to make sure that your
    communication is not encrypted, start your request URL with
    "<tt>http://...</tt>". You may find the following methods of the
    <tt>HttpServletRequest</tt> class helpful to avoid hardcoding the server
    name and the path at which your page will be deployed: <tt>getServerName(),
    getServerPort(), getContextPath(), isSecure().</tt> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Due to the heavy load on the DBMS server at oak, you have to
    <em>minimize</em> the number of requests sent to oak. Clearly, you
    cannot avoid contacting oak to obtain the item information while you
    generate the "item page" (the communication from (0) to (1) in the above
    figure), but beyond that, the tomcat server CANNOT contact oak for
    the rest of the transaction. In particular, you are NOT allowed to send a
    request to oak while you are generating the "credit-card-input page"
    or the "confirmation page" in order to obtain the item information that is
    being purchased (i.e., the communication from (3) to oak or from (5)
    to oak is not allowed). <!--
    <li>To make matters worse, you have to keep the Tomcat
    server "stateless". That is, you are not allowed to store any information related to an ongoing transaction either in a file, DBMS, or a global
    variable of the tomcat server. If a particular information needs to
    be "remembered" through a sequence of pages (like the ItemID and Buy_Price
    in the item page, the credit-card-input page and the confirmation page), it should be "pushed"
    to the client by embedding the information in the URL, cookie or (hidden) form fields.
    That is, the item information that you obtained through the initial communication from (0) to (1) cannot be stored in the Tomcat server
    for the rest of transaction. Making a server stateless is extremely
    helpful when we deploy multiple Tomcat servers for scalability.
    --></li>
</ol>
Given the second constraint, it is clear that the Tomcat server somehow has to
"remember" the item information obtained through the communication from (0) to
(1) for the rest of the transaction until the final confirmation page (6) is
displayed. This can be done in one of the following two ways:
<ol>
  <li>The Tomcat server can "push" the information to the client as HTTP
    cookies, hidden input form fields or as part of a URL link, so that the
    information is transmitted back to the server when the future request is
    made. This is essentially asking the browser to "remember" the item
    information. </li>
  <li>The Tomcat server itself can remember the information by starting a new
    HTTP session when the item page is generated and by associating the item
    information to the HTTP session. Once the session is established, any
    subsequent HTTP request from the same browser will be part of this session,
    so Tomcat will be able to retrieve the associted information to process the
    request. </li>
</ol>
Due to the potential risk of the "client-state-manipulation" attack of the
first approach, we decide to take the second approach in this project by using
the <tt>javax.servlet.http.HttpSession</tt> interface. If you are still not
clear on how to use an HTTP session to remember some information through a
sequence of pages, read our tutorial on HTTP session in servlet again. As you
implement new servlet class(es) for this project, make sure that you add
relevant entries in the <tt>web.xml</tt> file for for the URL mapping of your
servlet class(es).

<p>Since you will need to enable SSL on tomcat, you will need to modify
<tt>server.xml</tt> in <tt>/etc/tomcat7/</tt> as well. <em>When you
enable SSL, make sure that you enable it at the port 8443 (the default value
given in the existing server.xml file).</em> </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Other Notes</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some credit card number might be a counterfeited one. In order to
    validate a credit card number, two common ways are the "Luhn" and "Mod 10"
    check. (Reference: <a
    href="http://www.thetaoofmakingmoney.com/2007/04/12/324.html">How To
    Generate Valid Credit Card Numbers</a>). In this project, you are <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> asked to implement either one. If you
    desire, you may want to make sure that the credit card number includes only
    <span style="font-style: italic;">numbers(0~9), dashes, and spaces</span>
    and is not empty using Javascript, but even this is not a mandatory
    requirement of this project.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Part B: Optimizing for Mobile Access</h2>
Recently, users often access Web sites through their mobile devices, such as
Apple's iPhone and Google's Android phones. The browsers on these smartphones
mostly support the full HTML stanard and can access any Web page, but most pages
are not necessarily easy to view and navigate on a small screen yet. To enhance
user experience, some web sites now optimize their pages for smartphones, so
that they are easier to see on a small screen than the others. In this part of
the project, you now have to adjust the keywordSearch.html page, so that the
page is appropriately rendered both on a mobile device and a regular PC. You
are welcome to make your other pages mobile-friendly. To get full credits, you
at least have to make the <tt>keywordSearch.html</tt> page is properly designed for both browsers
in smart-phones and PCs. We will explains more details as follows.

<p>To see how pages are optimized for the best experience on a mobile device,
look at the screen captures of the following two pages. </p>

<center>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="yahoo.jpg" width="240" height="427"><br>
        <tt>http://www.yahoo.com</tt></td>
      <td>     </td>
      <td align="center"><img src="m.yahoo.jpg" width="240" height="427"><br>
        <tt>http://m.yahoo.com</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>
Both pages were captured by an Android device, where the left page is the
standard Yahoo home page at <tt>http://www.yahoo.com</tt> and the right page is
the mobile-optimized Yahoo page at <tt>http://m.yahoo.com</tt>. From the left
screen capture, we can see that the browser faithfully rendered the standard
home page, but the content of the page is not legible at the default zoom
level. In order to navigate through the page, the user is requied to zoom in to
enlarge the particular portion of the page. In contrast, the mobile optimized
version adheres to the following guidelines to make it easy to navigate on a
mobile device:

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>The mobile-optimized page has significantly less content than the regular
    page, leaving out less-frequently accessed content on the page to avoid
    clutter. </li>
  <li>The width of the mobile page is set to be the same as the width of the
    device. This setting ensures that the user is <strong>not required/able to
    scroll <em>horizontally</em></strong>. The user can scroll <em>the page
    <strong>only vertically</strong></em> in case the page cannot fit on a
    single screen. <strong></strong></li>
  <li>The default font size is large enough, such that the user is
    not required to zoom-in for reading the content of the page clearly. In
    fact, many mobile-optimized pages disallow zooming function to prevent
    accidental zoom in or out by the user. </li>
</ol>
To help you optimize your keywordSearch.html page for this project, we have
installed an Android emulator on our virtual machine. Read our instruction on
<a href="Android_Tutorial.html">how to start an Android emulator</a> and access
a few mobile Web sites using the browser in the emulator yourself, such as <a
href="http://m.nytimes.com">http://m.nytimes.com</a>, <a
href="http://m.yahoo.com">http://m.yahoo.com</a>, <a
href="http://m.wsj.com">http://m.wsj.com</a>. Please note that the emulator is
likely to be VERY slow and may test your patience. <p>

Now that you are familar
with a few mobile Web pages, your task is to revise the keywordSearch.html
page, so that it is easy to navigate <em>both</em> on a mobile device
<em>AND</em> a regular PC. In particular, your new keywordSearch.html page
should meet the following requirements:
<ol>
  <li>On a mobile device, the page width should be set to be the screen width
    of the device, so that the user is <strong>not able to scroll
    horizontally</strong> to navigate on the page. </li>
  <li>The search box and the submit button should not be larger than the width
    of the screen, again, to avoid any horizontal scrolling. </li>
  <li>The font of the text on the page should be large enough, so that the user
    is not required to zoom in to read the text. </li>
  <li>Disable zoom-in/zoom-out features to prevent accident zoom change on 
    the webpages.</li>
  <li>Finally, the page should display "natually" on a regular PC, without
    giving the obvious indication that the page is specifically designed for a
    device with a small screen. In other words, you should not limit the width
    of your page to 360px or less when a user visit your website throguh a
    traditional browser, such as the Firefox in the virtual machine.</li>
</ol>
You are not asked to make the page look very pretty or adding fancy effect for
a mobile device. However, you are welcome to do it. As long as the page
functionally accomodate both on a regular PC and a mobile device; namely,
conforming to the above requirements, you will get full credits for this part
of the project.

<p>There exist a number of ways to make a page viewable both on a mobile device
and a regular PC. For example, you can write a Javascript code, such that it
automatically detects the device width and adjusts the page arrangement
dynamically. It is also possible to configure your Web server, such that the
browser is automatically redirected to a mobile version of the site when
appropriate. While you are free to use any method that you feel comfortable,
you may find the following article particularly helpful in explaining how you
can ensure your page to display properly on a mobile device:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/putyourcontentinmypocket/">Put
    Your Content in My Pocket</a> by Craig Hockenberry </li>
</ul>
Even though this article was written specifically for iPhone, any WebKit-based
mobile browser (such as the one on Android) are likely to work well with these
techniques. Pay particular attention to the sections on "Adapting" and "Styling
for the iPhone". These sections explain "viewport" meta tag and CSS Media
Queries, which can be used to set the default screen width, and to apply
different CSS styles depending on the screen size of the device, respectively.
You may also want to read the <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/usingtheviewport/usingtheviewport.html">page
on viewport meta tag</a> and a <a
href="http://css-css.com/media-queries/">tutorial on CSS media queries</a> to
learn more details on these techniques. In revising your keywordSearch.html
page, you may assume that the screen width of a mobile device will never exceed
480 pixels.

<p><em>Please ensure that your new keywordSearch.html page displays properly on
the Firefox browser in our VM and the Android browser in the emulator to get
full credit.</em> </p>
-->
<!--
, one possibility is to use "CSS Media Queries". CSS Media Queries is part of the CSS standard that enables the browser to apply different styles depending on the screen. You may also find that the non-standard meta tag "viewport" useful in setting the default "viewport" or "zoom scale" of the Web page. While this
Note that this part of the project does not require you to create a completely separate version of your eBay Web site optmized for mobile devices. It is sufficient to revise just the keywordSearch.html page and nothing else.
Unfortunately, due to the rapid pace of advancements in the mobile space, there is no "standard" way to write a page viewable both on a PC and a mobile device. Possible options include:

<p>The <tt>team.txt</tt> is a plain-text file (no word or PDF, please) that contains the UID(s) of every member of your team. If you work alone, just write your UID (e.g. 904200000). <br /> If you work with a partner, write both UIDs separated by a comma (e.g. 904200000, 904200001). <b>DO NOT put any other content, like your names, in this file!</b></p>

<p>Please make sure that the <tt>build.xml</tt> in the zip file have the target
"build" that builds your web site into a single <tt>eBay.war</tt> file, and the
target "deploy" that deploys that .war file on the Tomcat server pointed to by
the environment variable <code>$CATALINA_BASE</code>. That is, <b>we should be
able to simply unzip your submission and run "ant build" and "ant deploy" to
deploy your web site on our machine.</b></p>

<p>Your final submission should include <em>all</em> files to make your Web
site up and running. Add any additional notes or comments that you think will
be helpful to the README.txt file. </p>

<p>As always, remember to allow sufficient time to prepare your submission once
your work is complete. </p>

<h4>Testing of Your Submission</h4>
The "grading script" for both Parts A and B submissions is the same file
<a href="p5_test">p5_test</a>, which can be executed like:
<pre class="code">cs144@cs144:~$ ./p5_test project5.zip</pre>
Add the path to the zip file if
necessary after downloading the script and setting its permission appropriately.

<p>You <b>MUST</b> test your submission using the script before your final
submission to minimize the chance of an unexpected error during grading. When
evertything runs properly, you will see an output similar to the following from
the grading script: </p>
<pre class="code">Stopping tomcat server if it is running...<br>Running 'ant build' to build your war file...<br><br> ... output from ant ...<br><br>Removing existing eBay application files on Tomcat...<br>Deploying your eBay application...<br><br> ... output from ant ...
<br>Now your Tomcat server is running with your application.<br>Please access your application through your browser.<br>Make sure that all application functionalities are working fine.<br>Don't forget to stop Tomcat server once you are done.<br></pre>
After you run the script, make sure to check the functionality of your site
using the Firefox browser in the VM and stop the Tomcat server when you are
done.
