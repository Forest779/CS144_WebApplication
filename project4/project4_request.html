<h3>Change History</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In Project 3, you developed the AuctionSearch Web service to provide remote
access to the eBay data. While a SOAP-based Web service is a great way to allow
other <em>applications</em> to access your data, it is not necessairly suitable
for an <em>end user</em>; the user has to write a SOAP client program to access
your data(!) In this part of the project, you will make the eBay data easily
accessible by end users through a Web browser, by implementing a Web site on
top of the Web service. </p>

<p>The Web site that you will implement will integrate three Web services: the
SOAP-based Web service to the eBay data (built in Project 3), Google Maps (to
display the location of an item) and Google suggest (to help users formulate
keyword queries). The overall architecture for this project is shown in the
diagram below: </p>

<p style="text-align:center; margin:10px auto;"><img src="project4-archi.png"></p>

<p>Note that the bottom-left rectangle is the AuctionSearchService that you
implemented in Project 3. We will make the same AuctionSearchService available
at <a
href="http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/axis2/services/AuctionSearchService">http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/axis2/services/AuctionSearchService</a>,
so that you can continue with this part of the project without relying on your
implementation of Project 3. <b>Please make sure to use the oak service for your final submission and demonstration.</b> Your own Web service will <b>NOT</b> be running locally on our grading system. If your code does not use oak, it will not work on our grading system and you will get significant penalty. 
The two gray rectangles in the
middle are what will be implemented in Project 4, which integrates the
AuctionSearch Web service, Google Map and Google Suggest servers. </p>

<p>By completing this project you will be able to learn: </p>
<ol>
  <li>How to build a Web site using Java servlet and JSP </li>
  <li>How to access remote Web services in SOAP and AJAX </li>
  <li>How to build dynamic user interfaces in Javascript </li>
</ol>
<p>We will be providing relevant tutorials and references to help you learn the
above topics.</p>

<h3>Part A: Implementing Your Basic Web Site</h3>

<p>In Part A, you will be making your eBay data accessible to Web browsers
through the following two URLs:</p>

<p>(1) <tt>http://localhost:1448/eBay/search?q=xxx&amp;numResultsToSkip=yyy&amp;numResultsToReturn=zzz</tt></p>
<p>(2) <tt>http://localhost:1448/eBay/item?id=xxx</tt></p>

<p>For the first URL, your application should return the list of ItemID and
name pairs that contain the keyword(s) "xxx" in their name, category or
description attributes. "yyy" indicates the number of items to skip from the
beginning of the list and "zzz" is the maximum number of items to return (if 0,
it should return all items). For the second URL, your application should return
the detailed information of the item whose ID is "xxx". For both interfaces,
you should format the results in HTML, so that the results are easily viewable
by a Web browser.</p>

<h4>A.1. Learning Application Development on Tomcat</h4>

<p>In Project 3, you used Tomcat (together with Axis2) to publish an existing
Java object as a Web serivce. In this part of the project, you will use the
Tomcat server in a more popular context, i.e., serving static and dynamic Web
pages for Web browsers. As you may know, most web applications/sites consist of
a fair number of files (like .html, .xml, .jsp, .jpg, .class, ...). In order to
simplify the deployment of a Web application, Tomcat provides a mechanism to
put together all files needed for an application in a single file, called
<em>Web Application Archive</em>. </p>

<p>First, learn how you can develop and create your own Web application archive
file for your application by reading the following tutorial: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../tomcat/index.html">Developing a Web Application on
    Tomcat</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Before you proceed to the next step, make sure you understand how to develop
and deploy a Web site using Java servlet, JSP, and Web application archive from
the above tutorial.</p>

<p>The <a href="project4.zip">project4.zip</a> file contains the basic skeleton
code for this project. It contains the <tt>AuctionSearchClient</tt> code (that
we provided in Project 3) to help you access AuctionSearchService. It also
contains three servlet classes, <tt>SearchServlet</tt>, <tt>ItemServlet</tt>,
and <tt>ProxyServlet</tt>, that you will have to implement as part of this
project. Go over the included <tt>build.xml</tt> file to understand what it
does. Pay particular attention to the target "build", which essentially does
the WAR file packaging for your eBay application. Note that all the files in
<tt>WebContents</tt> directory are automatically added to the WAR file,
including <tt>WebContents/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt>. Go over the <tt>web.xml</tt>
file to see how request URLs are mapped to the provided servlet classes. </p>

<h4>A.2. Implementing the Search Interface</h4>

<p>Now that you understand the structure of a Web application archive file and how
Java servlet and JSP pages can be used to serve dynamic contents, implement the
Java servlet that provides the search functionality for the eBay data.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>First, create an HTML page, <tt>keywordSearch.html</tt>, in your web
    application which contains a form where the user can enter and submit a
    keyword query. The form's action should point to your Java servlet
    available at <a
    href="http://localhost:1448/eBay/search">http://localhost:1448/eBay/search</a>
    and pass three parameters: 1) <tt>q</tt>, whose value contains the set of
    keywords the user types, 2) <tt>numResultsToSkip</tt>, whose value
    specifies how many items to skip from the beginning, 3)
    <tt>numResultsToReturn</tt>, whose value tells how many items to return (or
    display). Let users enter only the value for <tt>q</tt> and let the form
    automatically generate appropriate values for <tt>numResultsToSkip</tt> and
    <tt>numResultsToReturn</tt> for nice display. Note that the provided
    <tt>web.xml</tt> file maps the request to <a
    href="http://localhost:1448/eBay/search">http://localhost:1448/eBay/search</a>
    to the <tt>SearchServlet</tt> class.</p>
    <p><b>Important notes:</b> <em>For all links in your web application,
    including form actions, you should use relative URLs instead of
    absolute</em>. The reason is simple: if your links are something of the
    form "http://localhost:1448/MyWebApp/MyServlet/", they will <em>all
    break</em> if you make even a minor, unrelated change like switching
    Tomcat's port from 1448 to 80.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Implement <tt>SearchServlet</tt> to extract the value of the
    parameters <tt>q</tt>, <tt>numResultsToSkip</tt>, and
    <tt>numResultsToReturn</tt> from the request and retrieve the matching
    results from the eBay data. <!-- The retrieval of matching itemID and name pairs
    in your Java servlet must be done using the <code>basicSearch</code> Web
    service available at oak. --> Remember that for your final submission, you will have to modify the
    ENDPOINT_URL in <tt>AuctionSearchClient.java</tt> to <a
    href="http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/axis2/services/AuctionSearchService">http://oak.cs.ucla.edu/axis2/services/AuctionSearchService</a>
    to use the oak service for this project. Once the URL is changed,
    your servlet code will access oak Web-service functions simply by
    calling the methods of the <tt>AuctionSearchClient</tt> class.</p> 
    <p><b>Notes on CLASSPATH:</b> (1) When you implement a Java servlet, your
    code will depend on the Tomcat servlet library,
    <tt>$CATALINA_HOME/lib/servlet-api.jar</tt>. To avoid the "class not found"
    error during compilation, you need to pass the jar file location as the
    classpath to your Java compiler in your Ant script. However, you should not
    include <code>servlet-api.jar</code> or any of the other standard Tomcat
    jars in your .war file's <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> folder. These libraries
    are already available to all servlets running within Tomcat (all jars in
    <code>$CATALINA_HOME/lib</code> are), and may actually cause classloader
    problems if included in your war file. </p>
    <p>(2) The <tt>AuctionSearchClient</tt> class in depends on the Axis2 library
    files. To avoid any "class not found" error during compilation, the Axis2
    jar libraries at <tt>$AXIS2_HOME/lib</tt> should be passed to your Java
    compiler as a classpath. The library files are already available within
    Tomcat, so you do not need to include them in your war file.The above
    classpath issues are automatically taken care of if you use our provided
    <tt>build.xml</tt> and use the target "build" to compile and package your
    application.</p> 
  </li>
  <li><p>Forward the results of the query to a JSP page, which will display them
    to the user in a reasonable fashion.</p> </li>
</ol>

<p>The provided <tt>build.xml</tt> has another target "deploy" that copies the
.war file built from the target "build" to <tt>$CATALINA_BASE/webapps</tt>. You
can use this target to copy your packaged WAR file to Tomcat for testing. Take
a look at the <a href="../ant/tutorial.html">Ant tutorial</a> if you do not
understand the provided Ant script well.</p>

<h4>A.3. Implementing the Item Interface</h4>

<p>Similarly to the search interface, now create a static HTML page,
<tt>getItem.html</tt>, and implement <tt>ItemServlet</tt> class that will
return a page containing all of the details of an item (ItemId, name, start and
ending time, bid history, etc.) given its ID. The servlet is configured to be
available at <a
href="http://localhost:1448/eBay/item">http://localhost:1448/eBay/item</a> in
the provided <tt>web.xml</tt> file. Your implementation should take the input
parameter <tt>id</tt> whose value is the itemID of the item that you should
return. When implementing this servlet, make use of the SOAP service
<tt>getXMLDataForItemId</tt>, which returns the reconstructed XML
for a particular item. Take this XML and generate a web page which displays
this information to the user in a reasonable manner; for example, bids are
sorted in chronological sequence: the latest bid comes first. One way of doing this may
be to parse the XML into a JavaBean class of your own design, then pass that
object to a JSP page for display. Do not simply show the user an XML dump.
Also, do not generate the HTML output from your servlet directly. Instead,
forward your request from the servlet to a JSP page. In a nutshell, you should
assume that web pages are designed for web users so that you must conceal
non-related messages; for instance, debugging information.</p>
<!-- Make sure you modify your <code>web.xml</code> to add the correct <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</code> elements corresponding to your new servlet class and the URL at which the servlet is accessible.-->

<p></p>
<!-- <p><em>Here again, be careful with the classpath issue for servlet-api.jar and Axis2 libraries.</em></p> -->

<h4>A.4. Adding Navigational Links</h4>

<p>The two interfaces that you just implemented allow the user to discover
items that are relevant to a given keyword and to access the detailed
information of an item. However, the site is still difficult to use because (1)
the two interfaces are completely disconnected and (2) the user always has to
"go back" to the HTML pages to issue a new query.</p>

<p>Improve the usability of your site by adding the following navigational
help. </p>
<ol>
  <li>On the keyword-search result page (generated from your Search Interface),
    create clickable links for the ItemIds of each returned item. These links
    should result in the user receiving a page containing all of the details of
    that item.</li>
  <li>On the keyword-search result page, create <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b>
    links to allow users to navigate through next pages or previous pages of 
    search results.</li>
  <li>At the top of the keyword-search result page, include a text input box
    and a submit button by which the user can issue a new keyword-search
  query.</li>
  <li>At the top of the item page (generated by your Item Interface), include a
    text input box and a submit button by which the user can input a new itemID
    to get its information.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Hints on link-based browsing:</b>: Note that your servlet can be called
directly through a URL in the following way:<br>
<tt>http://localhost:1448/eBay/myServlet?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2&amp;param3=value3</tt><br>
where the string after the question mark contains parameters passed to your
Java servlet in the <tt>GET</tt> method. So you can implement link-based
navigation by generating result pages containing hyperlinks of the above
format, with appropriate parameters that instruct your servlet to return the
right result.</p>

<h3>Part B: Adding Maps and Query Suggestion</h3>

<p>Now that you have implemented the basic functionality of your Web site, it is
time to add more help to the users by adding more dynamic UIs. Before you
proceed, read about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax">JavaScript</a> as that is
the language used throughout Part B. You may also find the Javascript debugger
<a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> (for FireFox) helpful in
debugging your javascript code for this project.</p>

<h4>B.1. Adding Google Maps</h4>

<p>On your item page, add Google Map to visually display the location of the
item. Sometimes, To use Google Map on your site, you may need to signup for a <a
href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">Google Maps API key</a>.
<b>Where they ask for your web site URL, you'll need to enter
<code>http://localhost:1448</code>. </b> Once you are assigned a key, you may
use it in your web pages. However, for the simple(basic) Google Map API, you do
not need an API key to use it, for instance, a sample HTML page like the following:</p>

<div class="code">
<p>
&lt;!DOCTYPE&nbsp;html&gt;
<br>&lt;html&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;
<br>&lt;meta&nbsp;name=&quot;viewport&quot;&nbsp;content=&quot;initial-scale=1.0,&nbsp;user-scalable=no&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;
<br>&lt;style&nbsp;type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;html&nbsp;{&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100%&nbsp;}
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;body&nbsp;{&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100%;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0px;&nbsp;padding:&nbsp;0px&nbsp;}
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;#map_canvas&nbsp;{&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100%&nbsp;}
<br>&lt;/style&gt;
<br>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&quot;&gt;
<br>&lt;/script&gt;
<br>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;function&nbsp;initialize()&nbsp;{
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var&nbsp;latlng&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;google.maps.LatLng(34.063509,-118.44541);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var&nbsp;myOptions&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom:&nbsp;14,&nbsp;//&nbsp;default&nbsp;is&nbsp;8&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;center:&nbsp;latlng,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapTypeId:&nbsp;google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var&nbsp;map&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(&quot;map_canvas&quot;),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myOptions);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>
<br>&lt;/script&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;body&nbsp;onload=&quot;initialize()&quot;&gt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&nbsp;id=&quot;map_canvas&quot;&nbsp;style=&quot;width:100%;&nbsp;height:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/body&gt;
<br>&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
</p>
-->
</div>

<p>
To see what will happen in the above example: <a href="gmap-example.html">click here</a>.
You should copy the relevant parts of this sample into the JSP page you use
for processing results<!--, replacing YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE with the API key you've
been assigned-->. This example uses latitude and longitude to specify where to
center the map. You'll need to browse the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> to
discover how you can translate a location string like "Los Angeles, CA" into a
set of coordinates to display on the map. This type of address to coordinate
mapping is typically referred to as "geocoding". </p>

<p>For some "locations" you may not find a valid set of coordinates (e.g.
locations like "PAYPAL OK"). For these, you may choose to simply not display a
map, display a generic map such as of the entire world, or something else.
Whatever you choose, it should be user-friendly, so avoid showing cryptic error
messages or alert windows.</p>

<p>The basic map you just create must include the required limited
functionality, in paticular, navigation and zoom-in/zoom-out, but
feel free to spice things up by adding animations, information overlays,
additional map controls, and more.</p>

<h4>B.2. Adding Query Suggestion</h4>

<p>Your auction site users may not know exactly what they want to search for,
so in this last part you will be helping them formulate queries using <a
href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en">Google Suggest</a>. Try
out their query interface to get a feel for what it does. When you are finished
with Part B.2, the keyword-query box on your Auction Search web site should
behave similarly to the one on Google suggest.</p>

<p>The Google suggest interface uses AJAX to "silently" submit requests to a <a
href="http://www.google.com/complete/search?output=toolbar&amp;q=foo">REST-style
Web Service</a> in response to user input (keypresses). The replies are parsed,
and the returned suggestions are used to populate the drop-down list of
suggestions. As we learned in the class, this interaction takes place using the
XMLHttpRequest JavaScript object. Before you go any further, be sure you've
read the required reading about <a
href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/">AJAX</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax">JavaScript</a>, <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">DOM</a>, and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>.</p>

<h4></h4>

<h5>B.2.1. Developing a Google-Suggest Proxy</h5>

<p>Due to the asynchronous nature of AJAX, security is naturally a big concern
when using JavaScript. To reduce some security risks, <a
href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/JavaScript/JavaScript-Security/">JavaScript
security</a> enforces a "same-origin policy", which means that the scripts on a
page may only access information within the same domain. For example, a script
on a page like "http://localhost:1448/MySite/index.html" cannot make a request
for information from, say, google.com.</p>

<p>As a result, you will need to write a proxy (which runs on your Tomcat
server) to pass requests between your query interface page and Google's suggest
service. This proxy can be implemented by the <tt>ProxyServlet</tt> class that
we provided which is configured to accept HTTP GET requests at <a
href="http://localhost:1448/eBay/suggest">http://localhost:1448/eBay/suggest</a>.
Your implementation should extract the passed-in query string, issues a request
to the Google suggest service for that query (at
<tt>http://google.com/complete/search?output=toolbar&amp;q=&lt;your
query&gt;</tt>), and returns the results back to the original caller. You may
find the Java class <a
href="http://download.java.net/jdk7/archive/b123/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html">java.net.HttpURLConnection</a>
helpful in building your proxy. Note that your servlet should return the
<em>exact</em> XML data received from Google. You should thoroughly test your
proxy (by issuing REST-style requests to it and checking the results) before
moving on to the next step. Also note that, as your servlet should be returning
XML, your browser may not render it properly (you may see just a blank page).
Check the 'view source' option in your browser to see the data. Finally, if you
intend to use responseXML to access Google suggest responses as an XML DOM,
make sure that your proxy sets the "Content-Type:" HTTP header field to
"text/xml" in its response. Otherwise, your browser wouldn't be able to
recognize the response as an XML data, and won't be able to set responseXML
correctly. You can set the content type of a Java servlet reponse by calling
the <code>setContentType()</code> function of the response object.</p>

<h4></h4>

<h5>B.2.2. Developing a Google-Suggest Client</h5>

<p>After you have a functioning proxy, you'll need to write the "client" code
in your query interface page which issues requests to your proxy as the user
types and shows a list of suggestions. To do this, you will need to write a set
of <em>event driven</em> (asynchronous) functions in JavaScript which submit
requests and process results by populating a drop-down text box with a list of
suggestions. By asynchronous, we mean that these functions are invoked as the
result of "events", such as user key presses and data arrival, rather than by
some control flow as is typical in procedural programming.</p>

<p>While there exist a number of excellent javascript libraries (e.g. <a
href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a
href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, and <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI</a>) that provide javascript
implementations of common AJAX user interfaces like tooltips, auto-completes
and drop-down-boxes, you need to provide your own implementation of drop-down
box for this part of the project. (it is okay to use existing javascript
libraries for other parts of the project if you want to.)
<!-- If this is your first experience writing JavaScript, expect it to take a good amount of time to complete this part. -->
For the creation of a dynamic drop-down box in javascript, the following pages
provide an excellent tutorial: </p>
<ul>
  <li><del><a
    href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/ncz/">Creating an
    Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 1</a></del> (<a
    href="../javascript/suggest1.html">Local mirror</a>) </li>
  <li><del><a
    href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/ncz/column2/">Creating
    an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 2</a></del> (<a
    href="../javascript/suggest2.html">Local mirror</a>) </li>
</ul>

<p>Go over the above tutorial to learn about the HTML elements and their
associated events to create a drop-down-box like interface for query
suggestion. The tutorial provides a number of code snippets, which you are
welcome to use for your implementation. Your implementation of Google Suggest
should behave similarly to the one on Google Suggest. <b>In particular, as the
minimum requirement, you must ensure that as the user types input, a list of
suggestions are populated based on the partial query, which the user can
navigate with the mouse pointer or up/down arrows and choose with the enter
key or mouse click button. Moreover, under no circumstance do your code
crash when a user is navigating the list.</b></p>

<!-- You may find it helpful to start by reviewing the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">W3C XMLHttpRequest object specification</a>, as well as the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html">HTML forms syntax description</a> and discussion of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html">scripts in HTML</a>. Pay particular attention to what events are defined, how scripts may be invoked as the result of an event.</p>
<p>You may find the article <a href="http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html">Google Suggest Dissected</a> helpful in figuring out how you can create a drop-down-list-like box that contains the list of suggestions.</p> -->

<p>Remember that, when you issue a request to your servlet, you'll likely be
encoding the user's (partial) query in the URL. You need to "escape" special
characters in URL. For example, a space in a URL should be converted to "%20".
You do not need to manually do this replacement - most "web" languages, like
javascript, contain functions to do the proper URL encoding for a string, which
you simply need to call.</p>

<h4>Additional Notes for Project 4</h4>

<p>For all of Project 4, the mentioned functionality is the minimum
requirement. You are free, and of course encouraged, to add additional
features, make the page more user friendly, etc. Also, you are not required to
implement things exactly as indicated above. You may choose to, for example,
display item details in a popup bubble using some AJAX UI library instead of on
a separate page.</p>

<p>You must, however, abide by the requirement that your displayed result pages
must be for "human consumption" - not just XML data. Also, your site should
handle errors "gracefully". Your site should not show a cryptic Java error
message to the user. Finally, your should not use an existing javascript
library for Part B.2 of this project.</p>

<h3>Showing your Website</h3>

<p>By now you should already have a working website, and in this section you are going to 
prove it. In order to do this, you are asked to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://seleniumhq.org"><b>
Selenium</b></a> project, specifically, the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/" target="_blank">
Selenium IDE</a>.</p>

<h4>What is Selenium IDE?</h4>

<p>Selenium IDE is designed for automating browser tests. It is essentially a Firefox browser plug-in. 
Primarily, it is for automating web application tests. However, here we use Selenium as a "screen action 
recorder". That is, Selenium will allow you to record a sequence of actions on your website, and the 
grader will be able to <b>replay</b> such actions flow.</p>

<h4>Installing Selenium IDE</h4>

<ol>
   <li>Install <a href="http://mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank"><b>Firefox</b></a> if you do not 
   have in your host machine. Note that you should <b>NOT</b> install it on your virtual machine. The VM 
   will function as the web server, and your host machine will be the client trying your website. 
   (Please download the latest released version).</li>
   
   <li>Download the latest version of the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/" target="_blank">
   <b>Selenium IDE</b></a>. In your Firefox browser, when you click the download link, it will pop up a 
   window to proceed with the installation.</li>

   </iframe>
   </div>

   <p>
	<ol>
            <li><code>t1.html</code>: use your search page to search for <strong>superman</strong>.
                Then you should click the "next page" and "previous page" in your search result. Type "superman" again in the search box in the search result page.
The next step is clicking the first item in the "superman" searching result (it should be <em>a link pointing to a page that displays information about the item 1049430907</em>).</li>
            <li><code>t2.html</code>: use your search page to search for <strong>superman</strong> and click the second result(1045823269)</li>
           <li><code>t3.html</code>: use your item search page to search for <strong>1045348061</strong>. In the result page, search for <strong>123456789 </strong>.</li>
            <li><code>t4.html</code>: use your item search page to search for an empty query(click the search button directly) </li>  
</ol>

<h4><hr></h4>

<h3><a id="SUBMIT" name="SUBMIT"></a>What to Submit</h3>

<p>In this project you are creating a web site, consisting of both static
content (HTML pages, images, etc.) and dynamic content (JSP pages, Java
Servlets). This content is wrapped up as a Web application archive (.war) file
which can be deployed on Tomcat.</p>

<p>Your submission should consist of a single <b>project4.zip</b> file: </p>
<pre class="code">project4.zip
 |
 + team.txt
 |
 + README.txt
 + build.xml
 + TestCases
 |  + t1.html
 |  + t2.html
 |  + t3.html
 |  + t4.html
 + WebContents
 |  + keywordSearch.html
 |  + getItem.html
 |  + additional files (*.html, *.jsp, *.css, *.js, image files)
 |  + WEB-INF
 |      + web.xml
 + src
 |  + java source codes for the servlet (with your own naming/structure)
 |
 + lib
    + external java libraries used (not available in our VM)</pre>

<p>The <tt>team.txt</tt> is a plain-text file (no word or PDF, please) that contains the UID(s) of every member of your team. If you work alone, just write your UID (e.g. 904200000). <br /> If you work with a partner, write both UIDs separated by a comma (e.g. 904200000, 904200001). <b>DO NOT put any other content, like your names, in this file!</b></p>
<p>The <tt>build.xml</tt> in the zip file should have the target "build" that
builds your web site into a single .war file, and the target "deploy" that
deploys that .war file on the Tomcat server pointed to by the environment
variable <code>$CATALINA_HOME</code>.
<!-- This will automate the steps you learned in <a href="http://help.avs.com/OpenViz/deployment/elements/java/warfile/warfile.html">how to manually create a .war file</a> and deployment into a single command. -->
That is, <b>we should be able to simply unzip your submission and run "ant
build" and "ant deploy" to deploy your web site on our machine.</b></p>
  
    <p>Note that your final submission should
    include <em>all</em> files for this project. Add any
    additional notes or comments that you think will be helpful to the
    README.txt file. Once your submission file <b>project4.zip</b> is ready,
    submit via our submission page at &#xa0;<a
    href="http://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/15W-COMSCI144-1"><strong>CCLE</strong></a>&#xa0;.</p>

<p>As always, remember to allow sufficient time to prepare your submission once
your work is complete. </p>

<h4>Testing of Your Submission</h4>

<p>The "grading script" for your submission is the file
<a href="p4_test">p4_test</a>, which can be executed like:</p>
<pre class="code">cs144@cs144:~$ ./p4_test project4.zip</pre>
<p>Add the path to the zip file if necessary after downloading the script and set its permission appropriately.</p>

<p>You <b>MUST</b> test your submission using the script before your final
submission to minimize the chance of an unexpected error during grading. 
Please <b>make sure that your submission uses oak service</b>, not your
own local Web service. When evertything runs properly, you will see an output similar to the following from
the grading script:</p>

<pre class="code">Stopping tomcat server if it is running...
Running 'ant build' to build your war file...

   ... output from ant ...

Removing existing eBay application files on Tomcat...
Deploying your eBay application...

   ... output from ant ...

Now your Tomcat server is running with your application.
Please access your application through your browser.
Make sure that all application functionalities are working fine.
Don't forget to stop Tomcat server once you are done.</pre>

<p>After you run the script, make sure to check the functionality of your site
using the Firefox browser in the VM and stop the Tomcat server when you are
done.</p>

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

<p>Overall grading breakdown is as below and each feature will be tested with simple cases and tricky cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Servlet/JSP (40%) </li>
  <li>Google Map (20%) </li>
  <li>Google Suggestion / Search Interface (40%) </li>
</ul>
<!--
<p>Project 4 has a minimum set of requirements which the grader will verify by building, deploying, and navigating your site. All students must submit by the deadline following the procedure outlined above.</p>
<p>If you implement additional features for which you would like to provide an interactive demonstration (e.g. their use is not easily described in your README), you may schedule a time to provide a live demo of your web site by contacting the TA. You will not be penalized for not providing a live demo, it's merely an opportunity to show off some &quot;advanced&quot; features of your site.</p>
